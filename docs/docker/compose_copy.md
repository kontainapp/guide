# Image Tagging and Docker Registries
You can use the regular Docker commands to tag and image

You can use *Docker pull* and *Docker push* to work with the any Docker registry (local registry, Docker Hub, AWS ECR, Google Compute GCR, Azure ACR) in the same manner as regular Docker images.


<!-- ```sh
$ docker tag <image-id> <registry/imagename:tag>
$ docker pull <registry><imagename:tag>
$ docker push <registry>/<imagename:tag>
``` -->
