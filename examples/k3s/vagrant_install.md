# Description
We deploy a multi-node cluster for K3s using Vagrant and K3s.

Please note that this has been built on a Fedora 34 machine with Vagrant deployed with Libvirt/KVM as the VM virtualization provider rather than VirtualBox.

The same should work on Vagrant with VirtualBox with "Nested Virtualization turned on".
