## Kontain Guide
https://kontainapp.github.io/guide/


We are rapidly progressing towards a world of decentralized computing where applications are broken down into hundreds of connected microservices and significant computing power is being pushed to the edges of the network.

The key characteristics for enabling this new era are: Instantaneous Scale-out capabilities, low resource/cost usage, with high density and most importantly security of these computing services.

The current Unit of computing workloads is a Container that is bloated, inefficient, insecure and vulnerable, running on a shared kernel with a huge attack surface that needs to be secured using various mechanisms in a multi-tenant cloud environment.

We need a new unit of computing for this new era, a new type of "Container".


## A new unit of computing workloads - Introducing "Kontainer"
Introducing "Kontainer", a Docker-comptabile "Container" that retains all the advantages and tooling of Docker/Containers while having none of the issues above.  

A Kontainer supports almost instantaneous startup, eliminates resource bloat, works in highly dense computing environments, supports all the important runtimes, and importantly, is highly secure with almost no attack surface and strong isolation boundaries.

In addition, it works with no changes to current source code, and works with all the DevOps and CI/CD tooling, and Orchestration systems available today.

Please see [Install Guide](/gettingstarted/install) to start using "Kontainers".
