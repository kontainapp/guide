## Kontain Integration with Kubernetes

Since Kontain is OCI Compatible like Docker, we can also use it with any distribution of Kubernetes that supports Containerd or CRI-O runtimes, and use familiar Kubernetes development and CI/CD workflows and tools to deploy Kontain-based Images as pods.

Below we show how a kubelet in a Kubernetes Worker node interacts with an implementation of the CRI (Containerd or CRI-O) to launch OCI compatible containers.  Below we show how Kontainâ€™s krun interacts with the CRI implementations to launch containers in Kubernetes.

Below we show how kubelet on Kubernetes worker nodes works with CRI implementation runtimes (Containerd and CRI-O) and OCI to support multiple runtimes.

Kontain's 'krun' can work with either Containerd or CRI-O runtimes that manage the complete container lifecycle.  Below we show more details on how this works.
