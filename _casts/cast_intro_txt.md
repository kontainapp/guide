# We are rapidly moving to an era of highly distributed computing with Microservices, and edge computing clusters, that are constantly under the threat of attacks and hacks.

# Rather than bloated, inefficient, highly insecure Containers running on a shared kernel in multi-tenant environment, we need a new unit of Computing Workloads.
